In a few words, I will try to explain what was the beginning of everything...

I can start by saying that I love video games; so when I was a child I played for hours and hours, especially with one famous football game. But sometimes this generated discussions or complaints with my parents because I never did anything else in my free time. In my defence, I was a good student that always had great grades at school.

One day, I was in the middle of a game, when my dad appeared and sat behind me. I thought it would be to see me play and can show him how good I was at that game, but he said completely the opposite: "with all the time you spend on those games you should have already learned how to program it, how to make it or even better", he got up and went away.

One night, my dad's phrase was still in my head, so I decided to search on the internet, especially on YouTube, when I found a channel called La Geekipedia De Ernesto. There appeared my first programming language, Java, and I remember I only saw one video and then I went to sleep.

Over time, I saw one video per day, and everything started to change when the time that I used to spend on video games started to use in learning programming. All the things I saw made me feel more and more passionate about this journey. Sometimes I can realize everything that I have learned and done, and I'm really proud of this amazing change in my life.

On other hand, I must highlight the dedication and talent of my mum to Maths; days and nights of doing maths exercises together. I remember when I was in primary school and the teacher taught us to divide, with a confusing mechanism. I didn't understand anything, so I came back home and explain to my mum. She had already taught to me multiplication tables, so we found a new and more efficient method to divide.

So with these experiences, with Maths and Programming, I have decided to study Systems Engineering.

Thanks, mom and dad!
